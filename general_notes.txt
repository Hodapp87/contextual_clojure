Observations, possibly relevant, from the standpoint of not being particularly
familiar with Clojure and having a little experience with Lisp and Scala:

 - When I've been working mainly with OOP in C++, Java, and Python, and some
amount of lower-level C coding - all of these being imperative paradigm in
which you manage state - working with immutability feels very different, and
this is on top of functional programming already being a rather different
approach.
I feel like, from the start, the focus has to change from how you'll move the
state around to how you'll build a structure that your data just sort of
flows around. Sometimes, it's more static structures; other times, it's almost
like you are building machines that assemble themselves, do what they need,
and then are gone.
 - If I make a lazy sequence such as (iterate (fn [x] (+ x 1)) 1) then is
Counterclockwise incapable of displaying it in the REPL? It throws an
OutOfMemoryError when I try. clojurebot in Freenode #clojure, though, just
displays (1 2 3 4 5 ...). However, it seems this is more a result of
Clojure REPLs in general than anything of CCW.
 - Eclipse & Counterclockwise are a nice combination for developing Clojure,
however, I find it sluggish sometimes. Getting Eclipse to peg the CPU usage
at every keystroke is not difficult; for instance, if I enter the opening
quotation mark of a string, then all typing until I enter the closing 
quotation mark is extremely slow.
